fix bug that doesn't let you zoom in/out when only mcp or par is selected. only appeared after I added them both -- done
refactor code
let users load their own RData or any other files with algorithm selection results -- done
let users load their own scenarios -- done
add virtual best and single best solver statistics to the plot. also add mean mcp and par10 scores for each selector -- done
bug with not updating title and text for plot -- need to install github version of scatterD3
add better summary for gaps closed -- done
add more interesting theme -- done
change app layout -- don
maybe switch to dashboard -- done 

add more visualization options
add loading animations
scatter plot comparison with single best and virtual best solvers
do not reload data or selector if nothing changed
add summary for inputs: name of scenario, selectors, number of instances, mean runtime, etc.
add summary when all data is loaded

modules: module for selecting and loading scenarios; module for selecting learners; module for visualizing that takes outputs 
of both learner and scenario modules.
Maybe combine scenarioSource module with scenario module.
